// const
const animal = 'dog' // declare and initialize

// ? You cannot assign an already initialized constant variable since they are immutable.

// * IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE <IMMUTABLE> CONCEPT.
vehicles.pop()

// ? Since the constant variable is already initialized as an array, you can run all of the arr methods normally.
